## Summary
After completing the Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, I decided to do the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge as I wanted to develop my vanilla JavaScript skills.

## Coding Log
### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit
This challenge was a little difficult due to the way the key codes were used, however it all made sense overall. The use of the DOM brought back a lot of the basics covered at the beginning of the bootcamp. It was a good first challenge! 👩🏽‍💻
