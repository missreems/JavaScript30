## Summary
After completing the Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, I decided to do the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge as I wanted to develop my vanilla JavaScript skills.

## Coding Log
### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit
This challenge was a little difficult due to the way the key codes were used, however it all made sense overall. The use of the DOM brought back a lot of the basics covered at the beginning of the bootcamp. It was a good first challenge! 👩🏽‍💻

### Day 2: JavaScript & CSS Clock
Really enjoyed using the 'Date' object for this challenge and converting the time into degrees went well. But using transform and transition jogged my memory and reminded me that CSS is not only used for styling, but for movement and animation of elements as well.
