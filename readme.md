## Summary
After completing the Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, I decided to do the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge as I wanted to develop my vanilla JavaScript skills.

## Coding Log
### Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit
This challenge was a little difficult due to the way the key codes were used, however it all made sense overall. The use of the DOM brought back a lot of the basics covered at the beginning of the bootcamp. It was a good first challenge! 👩🏽‍💻

### Day 2: JavaScript & CSS Clock
Really enjoyed using the 'Date' object for this challenge and converting the time into degrees went well. But using transform and transition jogged my memory and reminded me that CSS is not only used for styling, but for movement and animation of elements as well.

---
### Day 3: CSS Variables
I learnt many things during this challenge. I got to understand a lot more about using data attributes and how I could use the following:

``` console.log(this.dataset)```

to get an object that contains all the data attributes from a specific element, this could be super useful!

---
### Day 4: Array Cardio - Day 1
This challenge was like a pop quiz that I wasn't expecting, but it actually went pretty well. I was able to use mostly all of the knowledge regarding array methods, which I'd learned back at General Assembly. I developed a better understanding of using the sort method. One of my favourite challenges so far! 💪🏽👍🏽

---
### Day 5: CSS Flex Panels Gallery
I got to learn quite a few things in this challenge, like using:

```transform: translateY();```

to get elements to begin off-screen and then to move down to it's original position. I realised small animations like this are used on websites quite often.

---
### Day 6: Ajax Type Ahead
This challenge was similar to something I tried to achieve some time back, however I got to learn a little bit about regular expressions when the following was used:

```const regex = new RegExp(this.value, 'gi')```

If I got a chance in the future, I would love to try a similar piece of logic out in my projects. 🤞🏾

### Day 7: Array Cardio - Day 2
Pretty good challenge! Was able to do most of it myself and used the tutorial to check my answers at the end. Great array cardio workout 👍🏽👊🏽
